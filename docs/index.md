It consists of markdown files (.md extension) and images (typically screenshots) referenced by those markdown files, and can be organized into further subfolders. The convention adopted here is generally one folder per document, where each folder contains a single markdown file and all the images referenced by it.

The content can be updated using a normal git worfklow, ie cloning the repo to a local machine and then editing the markdown files, or adding new ones, etc., and finally pushing the committed changes back to the origin. It is also possible to edit directly on github's web interface.
